Some of them\r\n still rely on horizontal scrollbars. While I believe this layout could be useful for some use cases, \r\n I felt that a default solution should avoid horizontal scrollbars entirely. Then I came up with this\r\n highly reusable directive.\r\n\r\nAll this work is based on the following assumptions:\r\n\r\n* If it is *flexible*, then it would solve most problems, even ones not aimed by the library author's;\r\n* Focusing on the task of *adding responsiveness*, in order to accomplish a greater objective (*easy to use tabular data*);\r\n* Do work with a *standard HTML table*, not requiring any extraneous markup;\r\n* Do *not change default tabular layout* unless a smaller display is detected;\r\n* Provide *convenience* without sacrificing flexibility;\r\n* By keeping *code base simple*, it is easier to reason about and evolve;\r\n* By fully covering with tests, it can *evolve without introducing bugs*.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Angular native implementation compatible with 1.3.4+;\r\n* Keep things DRY;\r\n* Supports static and dynamic (ng-repeat) rows;\r\n* Supports conditionally shown (ng-if) columns;\r\n* Supports dynamic headers (ng-repeat);\r\n* Supports nested tables (responsive or not in their own right);\r\n* Easy to apply any style on top of it;\r\n* Works with any base CSS framework; \r\n* Should integrate seamlessly with any table component you might choose to use.\r\n\r\n### Future Work\r\n\r\n* Choose what columns to show/hide according to a given screen resolution;\r\n* Choose when it would be best to hide columns or collapse all columns;\r\n* Define a header and/or custom template for collapsed columns/row;\r\n* Allow collapse/expand column details. \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n    <table wt-responsive-table>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <th>Column 1</th>\r\n            <th>Column 2</th>\r\n            <th>Column 3</th>\r\n            <th>Column 4</th>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n            <td>...</td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n    </table>\r\n\r\n### Directives\r\n\r\n#### wt-responsive-table\r\n\r\n * table: wt-responsive-table\r\n   * td: responsive-omit-title: title should be ommited\r\n   * td: responsive-omit-if-empty: no row for empty cells\r\n   * td: data-title: use to override the header for a given row/cell \r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Bower\r\n\r\n    bower install angular-responsive-tables --save\r\n\r\n### Application\r\n\r\n#### HTML\r\n\r\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"release/angular-responsive-tables.min.css\">\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"release/angular-responsive-tables.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n#### JavaScript\r\n\r\n    var app = angular.module('app', ['wt.responsive']);\r\n\r\n## Special cases\r\n\r\n### Header doesn't appear for a row / need to override header\r\n\r\nIt's possible to override a header with a `data-title` attribute:\r\n\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td data-title=\"column 1\">tom</td>\r\n        <td data-title=\"column 2\">jerry</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n\r\n### Changes to header text doesn't reflect in responsive mode\r\n\r\nThis is by design. To avoid expensive digest cycles only the content from the first digest cycle is used. \r\nThere are no watches being setup.\r\n\r\n### IE9 responsive hack\r\n\r\nBecause IE9 doesn't handle correctly a `display` CSS rule for `<td>`, if you need to support it, you can use the following style, only for IE9:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n<!--[if IE 9]>\r\n<style>\r\n/* rules for IE9 only */\r\n.responsive {\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n}\r\n.responsive td:nth-child(odd), .responsive td:nth-child(even) {\r\n    float: left;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n<![endif]-->\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nCSS based on original work by Chris Coyier (http://css-tricks.com/responsive-data-tables/). In this article, he covers approaches to responsive tables. I modified it to work around CSS specificity and to keep things DRY.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n",
